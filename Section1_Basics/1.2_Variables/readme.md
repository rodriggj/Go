# Variable Declaration

- [ ] See the this issue [Section 1 Lesson 2](https://github.com/rodriggj/Go/issues/2) for notes on Variable declaration, initiation, and overall construct.

> **NOTE:** When discussin Variables 4 main phases need to be addressed: 

- 1. `Basic Data Types` that can be assigned to a variable (e.g. String, Int, Boolean, etc.)
- 2. `Declarations` this is utilizing the `var` keyword and the declaration syntax to declare a variable
- 3. `Assignment` is taking a return value and assigning the value to the declared variable. We learned you can 1. _assign all_ return values, 2. _disregard_ return values, & 3. Utlizie _short declarations_ with the `:=` syntax
- 4. `Type Conversion` is the last topic, which deals with `casting` variables of a certain data type to another data type where possible.
